### Installation and usage
Program is written in java, solidity. it one may need solidity shoulde be installed ( https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install ) or install python 2.7 and then install Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, matplotlib,jupyter manually as follows.
#### Remix
If you just want to try Solidity for small contracts, you can try Remix which does not need any installation. If you want to use it without connection to the Internet, you can go to https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/tree/gh-pages and download the .ZIP file as explained on that page.

#### npm / Node.js
This is probably the most portable and most convenient way to install Solidity locally.

A platform-independent JavaScript library is provided by compiling the C++ source into JavaScript using Emscripten. It can be used in projects directly (such as Remix). Please refer to the solc-js repository for instructions.

It also contains a commandline tool called solcjs, which can be installed via npm:

> npm install -g solc

#### Docker
We provide up to date docker builds for the compiler. The stable repository contains released versions while the nightly repository contains potentially unstable changes in the develop branch.

> docker run ethereum/solc:stable solc --version
