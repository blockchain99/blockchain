## What is Bitcoin?
### Bitcoin is Internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation. 
###  Bitcoin consists of:
#### 1. A decentralized peer‐to‐peer network ﴾the bitcoin protocol﴿
#### 2. A public transaction ledger ﴾the blockchain﴿
#### 3. A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance ﴾consensus rules﴿
#### 4. A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain ﴾proof‐of‐work algorithm﴿

* Bitcoin Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges.

* Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins. The coins are
implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient. Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove
ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by
transferring it to a new owner. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. Possession of
the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin, putting the control entirely in the hands of
each user.

* Bitcoin is a distributed, peer‐to‐peer system. As such there is no "central" server or point of control. Bitcoin are created
through a process called "mining," which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing
bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network ﴾i.e., anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack﴿
may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions. Every 10 minutes on
average, someone is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin.
Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency‐issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need
for any central bank with this global competition.
